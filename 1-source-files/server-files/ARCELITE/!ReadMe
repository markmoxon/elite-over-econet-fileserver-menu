Archimedes Elite over Econet
by Mark Moxon, Warren Burch and Clive Gringras

This server contains two directories:

* ArcElite contains version 1.14 of Archimedes Elite
from Ian Bell's personal website.

* EliteNet contains the EliteNet application that
lets Archimedes Elite send scores to a multiplayer
scoreboard over Econet.

For information about Elite, see the !!ReadMe file
and Docs directory in ArcElite.

For information about EliteNet, click Menu on the
application icon in the Filer and choose Help from
the App. '!EliteNet' submenu.

I recommend that you copy both the ArcElite and
EliteNet directories to your hard disc and run the
applications from there. They can both be loaded
over Econet, but it is much faster to run them
from local storage, and you won't be able to save
your preferences in Elite unless you copy the game
to somewhere where you have write permissions,
which won't be the case with this fileserver.

Right on, Commanders!
